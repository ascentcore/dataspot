/**
 * Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points
 * in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group than those in other groups.
 *
 * Cluster analysis itself is not one specific algorithm, but the general task to be solved.
 * It can be achieved by various algorithms that differ significantly in their understanding of
 * what constitutes a cluster and how to efficiently find them. Popular notions of clusters include
 * groups with small distances between cluster members, dense areas of the data space, intervals or
 * particular statistical distributions. Clustering can therefore be formulated as
 * a multi-objective optimization problem.
