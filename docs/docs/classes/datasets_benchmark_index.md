# benchmark

In applied mathematics, test functions, known as artificial landscapes, are useful to evaluate characteristics of optimization algorithms, such as:
- Convergence rate.
- Precision.
- Robustness.
- General performance.

The artificial landscapes presented herein for single-objective optimization problems are taken from BÃ¤ck, Haupt et al.and from Rody Oldenhuis software. Given the number of problems (55 in total), just a few are presented here. The complete list of test functions is found on the Mathworks website.
