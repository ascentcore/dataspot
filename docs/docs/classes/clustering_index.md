# clustering

Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points
in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group than those in other groups.

Cluster analysis itself is not one specific algorithm, but the general task to be solved.
It can be achieved by various algorithms that differ significantly in their understanding of
what constitutes a cluster and how to efficiently find them. Popular notions of clusters include
groups with small distances between cluster members, dense areas of the data space, intervals or
particular statistical distributions. Clustering can therefore be formulated as
a multi-objective optimization problem.
