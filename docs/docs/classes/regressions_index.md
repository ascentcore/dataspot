# regressions

In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships
between a dependent variable (often called the 'outcome variable') and one or more independent variables
(often called 'predictors', 'covariates', or 'features').

The most common form of regression analysis is linear regression, in which a researcher finds the line
(or a more complex linear combination) that most closely fits the data according to a specific mathematical criterion.
For example, the method of ordinary least squares computes the unique line (or hyperplane) that minimizes the sum of
squared differences between the true data and that line (or hyperplane).

For specific mathematical reasons (see linear regression), this allows the researcher to estimate
the conditional expectation (or population average value) of the dependent variable when the independent variables
take on a given set of values.
