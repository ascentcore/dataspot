The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician,
eugenicist, and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as
an example of linear discriminant analysis.[1] It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson
collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species.
Two of the three species were collected in the Gaspé Peninsula "all from the same pasture, and picked on the same
day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus".[3] Fisher's paper was published in the
journal, the Annals of Eugenics, creating controversy about the continued use of the Iris dataset for teaching
statistical techniques today. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris
(Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the
width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a
linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set)

This data set contains statistics, in arrests per 100,000 residents for assault, murder, and rape in each of
the 50 US states in 1973. Also given is the percent of the population living in urban areas. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/deepakg/usarrests)
